/**
 * The authoritative state required to continue a running routine
 * (PRODUCT_PLAN_V1.2 Data/API — ActiveSession V2; R009).
 *
 * Binding rules:
 * 1. Remaining time is computed from **monotonic elapsed** timestamps, never
 *    from a counter and never from the wall clock (R007/R012).
 * 2. UI tick frequency is presentation only.
 * 3. TTS callbacks never advance time.
 * 4. Pause freezes effective elapsed time via `accumulatedPauseMs`.
 * 5. Resume extends `accumulatedPauseMs`; `phaseStartedElapsedMs` never moves.
 * 6. Background/foreground reconstruction reads this record only.
 * 7. Playback content comes exclusively from `snapshot`; the source Routine is
 *    never consulted after start (R019/R021).
 *
 * Field semantics:
 * - `*ElapsedMs` values are monotonic ms since boot (`MonotonicClock`).
 * - `updatedAtWallMs` is a real-world timestamp for display/age only; it never
 *   influences countdowns, so a wall-clock jump cannot move the timer.
 * - `bootCount` identifies the process/boot that owns the elapsed origin; a
 *   mismatch means the elapsed values are meaningless and must not be used.
